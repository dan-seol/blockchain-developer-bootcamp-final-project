# Blockchain-based document storage and access system

The idea mainly sparks from the concept of digital signatures and the fact that blockchain can be a distributed, decentralized database.

-   Users will submit their documents to the Blockchain system.
-   Any other user or systems can access them from the Blockchain with the required permissions from the user.
-   This system if implemented would lead to secure, paperless, and quick transactions and would be convenient to the users.
-  We can put a version control system too
- But I want to implement a Proof of Concept of it, scaled down given the constraints on time.
- Only assuming up to 2 users, a basic gui etc.
